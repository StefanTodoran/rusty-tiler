# Rusty Tiler

This repository contains the source code for a simple pixel art editor intended for creating tile-able designs. The square canvas can be set to any size, and will have its contents mirrored around it, updating with any changes. Designs can then be saved to `.png` or `.jpg`.

# TODO

* Add window icon
* Potentially replace druid?
